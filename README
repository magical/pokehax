This is a project i started a while ago and sort of forgot about.
The goal was just to dump data from the Pok√©mon games into simple text files,
without modifying or interpreting it any way. The benefit of text is that it
can be studied and analysed by eye and by the usual unix tools.
I didn't want to interpret the data because doing so can introduce errors, and
the point is for the data to be as raw as possible.
